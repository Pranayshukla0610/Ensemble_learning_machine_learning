## 🚀 Ensemble Learning Techniques Covered

### 1. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)
- Random Forest
- Reduces variance and overfitting
- Works well with high-variance models like Decision Trees

### 2. Boosting
- AdaBoost
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost (if included)
- Sequential learning where weak learners focus on previous errors

### 3. Stacking
- Combines multiple base models
- Uses a meta-model to make final predictions
- Improves overall predictive performance
